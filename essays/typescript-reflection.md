## Learning Typescript

Even though I have some background in similar languages, remembering the conventions of Typescript can be a bit tricky. I still sometimes find myself typing variables wrong, or feel the urge to write "var" instead of "const" or "let". However, it does remind me of when I was first learning other programming languages. When I learned Java and C++ and GDScript, I was still trying to get a hang of Object Oriented programming. With that all behind me, learning TypeScript has actually been pretty smooth, and I am surprised just how quickly I am now catching on. Although I'd like to say its a factor of my own skill, it's definitely thanks to how intuitive the language feels, especially coming from a other Object Oriented languages.

JavaScript though... I understand that it's just simpler for people who have never programmed, and I understand that it has it's own uses. Personally though, I have way more trouble remembering things like cloning an object in JavaScript than doing it the way I'm used to in Typescript. I'll definitely have to delve into both more, but right now the learning process is going very well.

## WODs and pain

Full clarification. I have a slower processing power than most human beings. My brain just solves problems differently. That's just how I'm built. Sometimes I'm going to have to stare at a problem and map out my solution that way. WODs and practice WODs have become a point of difficulty for me in that regard. Sometimes the time limit is just too much. As someone who prefers to stay away from generative AI as much as possible, sometimes I feel like I am being led to use them just to catch up. I haven't done so at this point in the class, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's how I end up. With the recent tragedy of WOD 2 and the flurry of DNFs, this has felt more and more like a push towards it, despite me knowing that there is active research to avoid such use in 314 right now.

As a concept, and for the most part, these WODs are great for keeping me in the flow of things, and sometimes forcing me to think faster than I normally would. That usually leads to more mistakes, but I have noticed that I am becoming somewhat quicker the more I do. While I feel like they are a bit much for me right now, I am hoping that I will be able to keep up in the future.
