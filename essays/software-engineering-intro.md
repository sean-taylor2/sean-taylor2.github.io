## First, a little history.
My knowledge of software engineering pretty much began when I was a child. I played computer games, like most people my age around that time. As a child, I could only sit there in awe as I wondered, "How do the colorful things even happen". 

To me, that technology was magic. 

As I grew older and wiser, I would eventually come to realize that computer games were a merger of art... and programming. To an outsider's perspective, thats really all there was to it. I never grew up with any other technology to really understand it as anything else. I could not have defined what a software engineer even was. So on top of pursuing art, I decided to become a programmer, to make those pretty colors that I liked.

I would eventually go to high school, where I finally got started.

## You... have to work with others?

When I began, I didn't really put a whole lot of effort into things. We only did short solo projects, and I would do the bare minimum. Formatting issues, bad variable names, breaking conventions - you name it, I did it. Surprisngly, I was never docked for it. That was probably a mistake. This would continue for a whole year.

That was until I was forced to work on a group project with my friend. I remember the first time he pulled my code from the github. He immediately became frustrated trying to read the accursed texts.

I then spent hours fixing things: correcting formatting issues, commenting, changing everything to follow convention. It was a long night, but one that stands out in my mind. It was the night I realized something important. If I am going to have to work with others, I am going to have to code for them. Not just me.

It was only through working with another human that I would piece together the processes that went into developing those games I enjoyed as a child. They were huge projects, with more than one human working together to deliver and maintain a polished product. By that metric, they were a kind of software engineer.

## What IS a Software Engineer?

Coming to class for the first time and having the term "software engineer" defined for me felt cathartic in a way. I had heard the term being thrown around before, but somehow never thought to dig deeper to understand what it meant. Now that I do, I would call myself an aspiring software engineer. I know that I enjoy programming, and I want to create meaningful products.

In the future, I want to gain experience following the process and writing readable and maintainable code. I know that this process will be challenging, but that’s what excites me most. For me, software engineering is no longer just “making pretty colors on a screen.” It’s about building something that lasts, that others can use, and that I can be proud of. That’s the future I want to work toward.
