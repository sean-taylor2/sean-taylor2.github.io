Heartcased is a visual novel computer game that follows tired investigator George, his loyal and determined partner Keith, and enigmatic convenience store worker E as they attempt to survive the depraved dystopia of Wick. Join them as they try to preserve what little safety remains in the city one criminal at a time, even if it means abandoning everything they thought they knew about themselves. The game features investigation mechanics, meaning that there are branching paths in dialogue as well as a health system to reward successful deductive reasoning.

This game is currently in development, and the team I am working with plans to have a demo on itch.io and Steam in the window of November - December 2025. I'm a programmer and a co-writer of the script on this project. I am using the Godot game engine and GDScript, a proprietary language for the aforementioned engine. I have contributed numerous elements, such as the dialogue system, player input system, and ui interaction. In terms of dialogue writing, I make edits to improve flow and remove fluff. Working on this project so far taught me valuable skills about teamwork and communication, as well as a basic understanding of git.
