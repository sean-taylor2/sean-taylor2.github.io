Don't be fooled by the name, I promise that no real humans were damaged in the making of this project.

Except maybe my professor, when forced to review this project.

This program was created in a course called Program Structure. Prior to this class, I hadn't really put too much effort in the way of programming outside of doing smaller projects in Java for lower level classes. Being my first exposure to a new programming language, it really opened my eyes that the real skill of a programmer is not memorisation of a specific language, but a skill to adapt. It was the first time I hhad broken out of my comfort zone and dedicated myself to relearning the basics of object-oriented and procedural programming.

The program itself is not really that impressive. It was simply coding an interface to create a type of human Object, assign that human different properties, and the ability to change these properties and delete them on the fly. It is very basic in that regard, but it stands out in my memory as the first real time that I could feel the switch flip in my brain.
